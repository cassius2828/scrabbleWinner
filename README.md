# scrabbleWinner
function to decide who would win in a 2 player game of scrabble
originally a lab problem for cs50 in C language, I thought it would be fun to do my version of the assignment in JS
note: my version prevents special characters and digits from being entered in at all, even though it would not register any points if I did not include the condition and regex.
